# Keep in mind

For Lombok you should enable the plugin in IntelliJ. Then you should enable annotation processing
in Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment->Compiler->Annotation Processors.

For persian or unicode messages, you should change encoding of IntelliJ to UTF-8. This can be done
in Settings->Editor->File Encodings. remember to check the Transparent native-to-ascii conversion
